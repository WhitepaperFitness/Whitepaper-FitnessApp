# Welcome!

## Welcome to HHT Fitness Website

Currently, the covid-19 epidemic is very complicated so most people have to stay at home. Therefore, people cannot go to the gym to train themselves, and exercising at home will easily cause depression and injury due to improper training. For that reason, our team wanted to make a website to guide people to practice at home with videos of coaches. In addition, there are instructions on how to eat and calculate portion sizes to gain weight, lose weight or keep it off with a clean diet. Along with that, the web also sells additional food and exercise equipment such as an e-commerce website.
